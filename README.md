Data Analysis and Visualization for Biological Systems

This repository contains projects from **BME 163: Applied Visualization and Analysis** at UCSC, showcasing skills in data visualization, biological data analysis, and reproducible Python workflows. Each project focuses on creating high-resolution, publication-ready figures for complex datasets.

## **Key Projects**
1. **Template Replication**: Programmatically recreated complex layouts with Matplotlib, using precise panel sizes and custom color schemes.  
2. **Scatterplots and Histograms**: Visualized parsed data with transformations (e.g., `log2`) and color maps like Plasma.  
3. **Cell-Type and Heatmap Visualization**: Mapped cell types using median-based positioning and proximity heatmaps.  
4. **Genomic Data Analysis**: Parsed FASTA, BED, and GTF files to visualize splice junctions and gene loci.  
5. **Gene Expression Heatmap**: Created normalized heatmaps and circular histograms for gene phases.

## **Skills and Tools**
- **Data Parsing**: Processed biological data formats (FASTA, BED, TSV).  
- **Data Visualization**: Developed high-quality visualizations using Python and Matplotlib.  
- **Scripting**: Built reproducible workflows with command-line interfaces.  
- **Techniques**: Normalization, proximity calculations, and nucleotide frequency analysis.
